# Toronto-Hydro-Demand-Prediction

## Objective:
To optimize the "day_ahead" schedule for Ontario Electricity Market, our team performed intense analysis on weather data and historical demand data and created a model to predict hourly demands for the next day. Scheduling the appropriate resources requires accurate forecasts and this will ultimately result in reducing market-clearing prices.
